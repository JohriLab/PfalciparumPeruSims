# PfalciparumPeruSims
Population genetics forward-in-time simulations of P. falciparum populations in Peru

pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries.slim: first version of script where population sizes are estimated using effective population sizes and no recombination
run_pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries_2.sh: bash script to run this version

pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries_incidence.slim: second version of script where population sizes are estimated using the incidence and no recombination
run_pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries_incidence.sh: bash script to run this version

pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries_incidence_rec.slim: third version of script where population sizes are estimated using the incidence and with recombination=0.5
run_pfalciparum_Peru_timeseries_incidence_rec.sh: bash script to run this version
